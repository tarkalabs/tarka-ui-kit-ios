# Localization in Tarka UI Kit iOS

Tarka UI Kit supports localization for the strings that have been used in the kit.

## Steps to do localization in your project for Tarka UI Kit strings

1. Create a new Strings file, name it as `TarkaUILocalizable` and add it in your project

2. Choose the `TarkaUILocalizable` and in File Inspector, click localize

3. Choose the project and in info, you can see the `Localizations` as the last section, click the + icon to add the desired language 

4. Choose the language and click finish

5. Now the file `TarkaUILocalizable` will be expandable. If you expand it, you can see separate files for each language

6. Localize the strings that provided in `Localization+Strings` file, with appropriate languages in your localizable file

7. You are done with localization. Now change the language and run the app

##### Note:
It is supported even if you are already using localization in your app.
Follow the same steps. It will work as expected.
